# salesforce-dx-template

A Salesforce DX template containing helpful stuff to initialise new projects, and containing GitHub workflows for easier deployment.

# Setup

See [docs/devops](docs/devops) for instructions on how to setup this template in a new project.

When the repo is up-and-running, you can make changes in a Scratch Org and deploy it to production. See next paragraph.

# Making Changes and Deployment

You can now create feature branches and create PR's. This requires validation and code reviews, to ensure quality and safety before deploying to production. New changes merged to `main` are automatically deployed to preprod. After a quick validation in preprod, you're good to go and can easily deploy to production ðŸŽ‰
