# ü§ì Develop

After all setup is done in the previous step, you're ready to develop!

You can now (typically):

-   Create feature branches and create PR's
-   This requires validation and code reviews, to ensure quality and safety before deploying to production
-   New changes merged to `main` are automatically deployed to preprod
-   After a quick validation in preprod, you're good to go and can easily deploy to production üéâ
